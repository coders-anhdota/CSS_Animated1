		<p>The text-decoration-line property sets the kind of text decoration to use (like underline, overline, line-through).

			Tip: Also look at the text-decoration property, which is a short-hand property for text-decoration-line, text-decoration-style, and text-decoration-color.

		Note: You can also combine more than one value, like underline and overline to display lines both under and over the text.</p>
